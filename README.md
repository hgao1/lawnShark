# lawnShark

Create a robotic lawn mower made out of cheap, accessible parts and successfully cuts grass (the hardest part). 

## Description

This github currently contains just the arduino IDE code, 
in which a specific set-up has to be done on the arduino physically. 
See: [lawnShark website](http://hillarywgao.com/lawnShark.html)

Future contributions will eventually contain a python script that will communicate with the arduino, 
and hopefully even a GUI. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

No specific dependencies needed, 
just the Arduino IDE software and python 3. 

### Installing

You can download any IDE file directly from this page, 
and upload to your arduino IDE.
